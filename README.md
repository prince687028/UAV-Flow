This repository contains the source code and dataset information for UAV-Flow, the first real-world benchmark for language-conditioned, fine-grained UAV control. UAV-Flow is designed to enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to closely replicate precise, expert-level flight trajectories demonstrated by human pilots.
